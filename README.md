# How To Use It
Git clone this project, open up FrontEnd/main_page.html and click "PREDICT"
More detailed instructions coming later

# Project Goal
Create my own dataset using REST API and GraphQL calls that I can use in machine learning tasks.
Focused around the popular videogame DOTA 2. 
I am using this as a way to reinforce my machine learning and neural network knowledge, while adding the unique aspect of building my own dataset. 
I am also using this as a way to learn full-stack development.

# Data Processing
Using the Open DOTA REST API and Stratz API GraphQL Application, creating my own dataset to use
Handling missing data, preprocessing, and feature engineering

Storing data in an SQLite database for convenience and lightweight use

In the future, I plan to implement

# The Model
Testing different types of machine learning models and neural networks for the predictor. For now, using a random forest model.

# The Website
Given that I have never designed a website before, I wanted to take my time and learn HTML, CSS, and REACT. 
My primary goal in designing a website is to have a functional and responsive website, but I also want it to look professional and engaging, while fitting the darker color pallete of DOTA 2.
Currently, the backend is not implemented, but will be by the end of September.
